    <h1>Whenever you get discouraged..</h1>

    <p><h2>Knowing What's Possible Vs Knowing What's What</h2>

        <strong>What is learning about?</strong> Okay so during the course of this process of learning how to code you are going to become discouraged a lot of times. The most common reason is because you get <strong>completely overwhelmed</strong> by <em>all</em> the shit you have to learn and you're like...
    </p>

    <p>How am I supposed to remember all this??</p>

    <p>When that happens, please remember the <strong>four domains of knowledge</strong> and that learning.. isn't actually about memorizing anything. Because you can't. And you never will. Some people might, maybe, like the smartest of the smartest peeps in the world, but if that's how you're approaching learning, you are going to be discouraged.
    </p>

    <p> <strong>Four Domains of Knowledge:</strong> There are the things you...
    <ul>
        <li>know you know</li>
        <li>know you don't know</li>
        <li>don't know you know</li>
        <li>don't know you don't know</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>The Point of Learning is to Learn What's Possible</h2>

    <p>Learning isn't about knowing everything, but to take as many things out of the <strong>things you don't know you don't know</strong> box. Even if you aren't able to remember everything, at least you know what's possible and you know what to look up or you'll have a better idea of what to google next time when you do have a problem. <em>e.g.</em> before you learnt about bash and the unix shell, you had no idea the <code>$ grep</code> function existed and you wouldn't have a clue how to use regular expressions to automate data mining.</p>

    <p>And maybe you still don't know what <code>$ grep</code> does fully or how to use it or all of the arguments that can be applied or how to apply them,</p>

    <h1>But that's okay!!</h1>
    <p>Because what's important is that you're trying! And learning! And the more you try and learn (and even fail), the better you will get. I promise you.</p>
